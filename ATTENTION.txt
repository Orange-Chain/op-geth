Do you guys ever used 'go get github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth'?

This operation will fail due to mismatch of package name, the error message is:

go: github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth@v1.101106.0: parsing go.mod:
	module declares its path as: github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
	        but was required as: github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth

can you please rename the package in go.mod? 

No one want to fork the repo and rename the package and use it.

Thanks
